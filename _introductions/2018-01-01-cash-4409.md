## Old introduction

### Description

<p>In CASH there are two types of minting, proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS). The PoW minting rate is regulated by Moore&#39;s Law, which dictates that our ability in PoW grows exponentially. The PoS minting introduces a maximum 10% annual inflation. CASH transaction (tx) fees are destroyed to counter inflation. So overall the CASH minting design is still a very low inflation comparable to Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin and many other alternative coins CASH does not have a fixed coin supply cap. There is a 47,433,600 coin maximum value in the source code, but that is only used for consistency checking and is not meant to be part of the minting design.</p>
