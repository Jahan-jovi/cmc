## Old introduction

### Description

<p><span>Cryptum is a network of projects funding high-end board games publishing, starting with the first cryptocurrency mining strategy game named "Blockchain". One of the paramount goals of Cryptum is creating a profitable investment for all token owners even outside the exchange trade.Â </span><span>This is achieved by offering free access to all published games based on token ownership tiers, and optional profit shares from all Cryptum projects.</span></p><p><span>Currently, there are two main projects that will generate revenues - a long term board games design and publishing business offering between 20 and 40% of its profits, with 4 games and 5 expansions already under development, and a failsafe mining project funded by 30% of the initial sale, which will contribute with up to 50% shared profits for the first 2 years of operation.</span></p><p><span>In addition, all token owners are entitled to receive initial amounts from the upcoming mineable Cryptumcoin, which will be used in some of the Cryptum services.</span></p>
