## Old introduction

### Description

<p>Motocoin<span> is a cryptocurrency utilizing an innovative </span>proof-of-play<span> scheme where coins can only be mined by cognitive workload - playing a 2D motorbike simulation game, which is different from Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies that use a </span>proof-of-work<span> scheme where miners must perform difficult computations and then use proof of that work to secure coin transactions and get their reward. Motocoin was historically dominated by bots, but is currently testing a new security model that better enforces balanced play. </span></p>
