## Old introduction

### Description

<p>Plutus is a decentralized payment application that allows users to make purchases with Bitcoin and Ether anywhere. Users are simply required to load the app with BTC or ETH and hold the <span>phone over the card reader for the payment to complete.</span></p><p><span>Plutons are Ethereum-based tokens that can be earned as a reward for shopping with Plutus. </span><span>Plutons will be available to convert on the Plutus exchange network, allowing users to make in-store purchases with zero fees on conversion.</span></p><p>Only 850,000 Plutons (PLU) were available for sale during the ICO, which represents 4.25% of the total supply of 20,000,000. Issuance for the remaining 95.75% will be limited and locked in rebate smart contract pool and NOT owned by Plutus.it, which means there will be a very low circulation from the initial distribution and a total of 20 million Plutons ever created.</p>
