## Old introduction

### Description

<p>SportyFi is a decentralized sports investment &amp; funding ecosystem. It aims to<span> introduce a brand new industry of sports crowd micro-financing, while providing athletes, clubs and sport organizations with macro-funding on their respective end. The SPF token is an ERC20 token based on the Ethereum network. It<span><span> </span>will be the<span> </span></span>primary means of transactions<span><span> </span>on our platform. It will be used both for investing in athletes (and crowdsourcing donations) as well as other transactions on the platform—which includes paid advertising, paid reach and other premium services offered. The SPF token will be<span> </span></span>listed on several exchanges<span><span> </span>to integrate it into the wider crypto ecosystem. Token holders will be able to participate in DAO voting steering the SportyFi Professional Fund’s operation.</span><br /></span></p>
