## Old introduction

### Description

<p>The idea behind CryptoWi is to bring cryptocurrencies to the masses and to give cryptocurrencies a real meaning and porpuse, making it an everyday manetary instrument. This will be achieved through a WiFi sharing app which is monetized so that the general public has an incentive for using it.</p><p>The user is awarded<span> </span>with CryptoWi tokens (WIC) for each correct correct password uploaded in order to grow the network initially. The user will also be able to set a custom price in WiC for each of these networks. Anybody who wants to connect to these networks will have to pay this amount and it will be credited to the original password uploader. </p>
