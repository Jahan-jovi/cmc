        "Description": "Aion (AION) was born with the purpose to build a network where people can improve the scalability, privacy, and interoperability through multi-tier blockchain system.  The AION is the first cross blockchain token. The AION token not only support the common blockchains but also create new blockchains and to pursuit inter-chain bridges. By a multi-tier blockchain system, AION will help to solve all the difficulties in scalability, privacy, etc in blockchain networks.",
        "Features": "Aion has been powered by many competitive attributes. Firstly, AION-1 operations are including the ability for users to stake tokens to back validators of Aionâ€™s consensus process. Moreover, it has many applications, and the AVM makes tokens fuely based on the complexity of the application. In addition, the AION has the inter-chain bridges, which helps AION tokens be sticked into a bridge registry contract.",
        "Technology": "Through the high-performanced bridges mechanism, Aion facilitates inter-blockchain communication which can address the scalability problems. Moreover, the Aion does not need sacrifice interoperability with other blockchains, but it allows custom blockchain design including different consensus algorithms and virtual machines.",
        "Sponsor": "In 2017, Aion technical paper officially published. By a team of world class developers, and supported by strategic partners and advisors, the Aion platform is a community driving the development of projects as well as individuals."
