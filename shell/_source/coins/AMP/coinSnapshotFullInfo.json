A similar amount of AMPs on the more mature and larger network will allow a piece of content to reach the attention of more users on it, increasing the value of each AMP.<\/p><p>As well, a larger user base generates more interaction and content in circulation, increasing the total amount of attention\u00a0 allocated to, and available on, Synereo.<\/p><p>As Synereo functions as a platform for new applications and markets, AMPs may eventually become a de-facto currency.<\/p><p><strong>Extensibility <\/strong><\/p><p>Synereo enables a new wave of distributed applications that piggyback on the social platform and its user base.\u00a0 Music streaming, content distribution, distributed marketplaces, collaborative platforms, and many other applications\u00a0 can all take advantage of Synereo\u2019s fully decentralized and distributed technology and deploy systems that truly benefit both\u00a0 businesses and end users while removing the need for any middleman.<\/p><p>Synereo is open-source and very modular, designed for rich extensibility.

            "Technology": "<p><strong>Synereo AMPs: A Voice Amplifier <\/strong><\/p><p>AMPs, Synereo\u2019s tokens, serve as a way to Amplify the flow of information in the network, increasing its ability to propagate to peers.<\/p><p>They work in two ways:<\/p><ol><li>A user may Amplify his own posts: status messages, pictures, created events, etc. Depending on the amount of AMPs used, the post will gain greater visibility in the stream of his Synereo friends - and in adjacent, connected areas of the network through them. A user may also Amplify his friends\u2019 posts in such a manner, helping to propagate the friends\u2019 messages. Thus, a group of friends may band around a common interest and Amplify it together, making sure it is heard as it reaches more of their collective Synereo. \u00a0The originator of Amplified content will receive a portion of the AMPs invested by his peers. Another small portion will be used for the maintenance of the platform; people donating their storage and bandwidth to the network. The majority of AMPs will go to those who are exposed to the content, compensating them for their time and attention.<\/li><li>Advertisers may use AMPs to created sponsored messages, reaching target audiences based on their interests and activity on the network. NOTE: A user of the system may always opt-out of receiving messages from specific advertisers, about specific topics, or altogether.\u00a0Most of the AMPs used to advertise to you will be paid to you directly. This is a way to gain from your participation in the network and from the value you generate for it. The more you participate, the more the network is familiar with you and your interests, and the more influence you have on the network, the more your attention is worth!\u00a0<\/li><\/ol><p><strong>Advertising on Synereo<\/strong><\/p><p>Facebook\u2019s revenue for Q4 2014 was $3.85 Billion. This is the sum of money that was spent for Facebook content visibility alone, and does not account for resources invested in the creation of the content being advertized or the middlemen optimizing this process.<\/p><p>This grand economy relies on us - the users of the social network - in its entirety, but we do not share in its gains. Advertisers on these\u00a0 networks are not happy campers, either. The advertising platforms, along with the service providers, are profiteering middlemen that take a major cut for supplying your attention to them.<\/p><p><strong>How is advertising on Synereo different? <\/strong><\/p><p>Synereo users are a real part of the advertising ecosystem rather than merely existing as pawns on someone else\u2019s playing board. The advertisers\u2019 funds do not remain in the hands of major corporations, but are delivered straight to potential customers around the globe as a form of compensation for their attention.<\/p><p>Synereo enables a two-way relationship between advertisers and prospects. Advertisers can target specific communities, contributing AMPs to causes, organizations or projects - and the people that enable them. On the other hand, an advertising campaign initiated by a popular\u00a0 charity or cause can maintain minimal advertising spend while relying completely on \"crowdsourced\" AMPing by its supporters.<\/p><p>Synereo\u2019s information flow logic greatly benefits advertisers who have committed to content excellence, increasing the spread of content engaged with by users recognized for their curation abilities and positive influence on the network; their ability to contribute to the attention economy underlying Synereo.<\/p><p>Similar to real-world viral campaigns, a well planned advertising effort would target influencers of the relevant topics and audiences to the campaign with excellent content that, if appreciated, will be distributed on Synereo organically rather than by \u201cbrute forcing\u201d it with AMPs.<\/p><p>The lesser the quality of the content you see, the more you will be compensated for it!<\/p>",
