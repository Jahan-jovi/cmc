During this time hourly snapshots of NXT Balances were\u00a0taken and averaged, the balance was then given to holders\u00a0on a 1 to 1 scale. ARDR issued as an asset on the NXT 1.9 Blockchain until the full release of the Ardor Platform in Q3 of 2017.<\/span><\/p><p>A second set of tokens <span>will be given to users according to their NXT holding\u00a0on the day the first block of Ardor is mined, meaning that the balance won\u2019t be measured and averaged over a period of time, but will instead be given on a 0.5 \u2013 1 scale according to the one snapshot taken at the moment of the Genesis Block. These tokens will house the features of the first Ardor child chain.<\/span><\/p>",
