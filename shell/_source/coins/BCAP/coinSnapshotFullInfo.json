They are a sector specific, but multi-stage venture capital investor that seeks to gain diverse exposure to the Blockchain economy while offering unique co-investment opportunities and proprietary deal flow to investors. Blockchain Capital was co-founded by\u00a0Bart Stephens,\u00a0Brock Pierce, and\u00a0Brand Stephens\u00a0who also act as the fund\u2019s managing partners.<\/span><\/p><p><span>The BCAP tokens grant holders a portion of the profits earned by the fund. The fund\u2019s managing partners will collect a 2.5% management fee and a 25% performance fee. The remainder of profits will be distributed to token holders. The BCAP token will be fully transferable, providing liquidity that is not usually found in traditional venture capital markets. The team anticipates making 10 \u2013 20 investments at an average of $500,000 per deal.<\/span><\/p><p><span>The tokens themselves will represent a maximum of 20% of the third fund they are raising: they will raise $40 million through traditional channels for a venture capital firm. These investments won\u2019t be tokenized, but they will have the same\u00a0payout structure.<\/span><\/p>",
