            "Features": "<p><strong>Large Distribution &amp; Low Inflation<\/strong><br \/><br \/>78.5 million ClubCoin was mined to start and these coins are being distributed to BitClub Network members. See disclaimer below. No new coins will be created using Proof-of-Work method, all new coins will be issued from the 20% yearly interest paid to holders of ClubCoin who are staking their coins. This drops in half every 2 years.<br \/>\u00a0<br \/><br \/><strong>Built-in Users = Adoption<br \/><\/strong><br \/>ClubCoin was first introduced to BitClub Network members as a strategic way to distribute the coins across a global network of users. This model gives ClubCoin a unique advantage over most coins in the market as it will continue to be issued and distributed worldwide to a fast growing user base.<br \/>\u00a0<br \/><br \/><strong>Blockchain Security<br \/><\/strong><br \/>ClubCoin has it&#39;s own Blockchain and distributed network of nodes that make it very secure against attacks and hard to get 51% consensus. Other digital currencies that are only Proof-of-work face issues due to their reliability on large-scale mining operations. ClubCoin also boasts a powerful Block Explorer.<br \/>\u00a0<br \/><br \/><strong>Merchant Platform<br \/><\/strong><br \/>A new Merchant Platform is being built that will allow online and brick &amp; mortar businesses to accept ClubCoin risk free, within a secure and reliable environment. Since many members will be eager to use this platform we have created a very strategic way to sign up new merchants. We have big plans for ongoing development of the entire ClubCoin ecosystem.<\/p>",
