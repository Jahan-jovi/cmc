        "Description": "BitShares is a distributed exchange platform for trading cryptocurrencies without leaving a blockchain. BitShares (BTS) was first introduced in a White Paper titled “A Peer-to-Peer Polymorphic Digital Asset Exchange” by Daniel Larimer, Charles Hoskinson, and Stan Larimer. This is a brand of open source software that is based on blockchain technology as used by Bitcoin. Unlike bitcoins, which do not bring revenues to their owners, BitShare can be used to launch DACs (Decentralized Autonomous Companies) to issue shares, generate profits and distribute profits for shareholders. As such, BitShares is making profitable companies that people want to own shares, thereby generating profits for their shareholders. The first DAC launched by this process is called BitSharesX, a distributed asset exchange based in Hong Kong. BitShares was originally launched under the name of ProtoShares (PTS); it was renamed to BitShares (BTS) and "reloaded" in November 2014 by merging some products into BitShares (BTS).",
        "Features": "Here is the feature list of BitShares coin: A predictable stable price with reduced volatility; A relatively reliable solution to predict the future value of a token; A unit of account distinct from assets with capital gains or losses (which has increased tax liability); Hedging against volatile Cryptocurrency markets and price action; A BitShares market-pegged asset (MPA) can be viewed as a contract between an asset buyer seeking price stability and a short seller seeking greater exposure to BTS price movement.",
        "Technology": "Blockchains that is analyzed under DAC demonstrate the importance of reducing transaction costs, speeding up transactions and making the system scalable to compete with existing financial institutions. BitShares is designed with these limitations in mind, eliminating the Bitcoin Proof of Work (PoW) security for better classified and Proof of Stack (DPoS). This allows BitShares to have near-instant transactions with very low fees and a larger-scale Visa/PayPal infrastructure and more.",
