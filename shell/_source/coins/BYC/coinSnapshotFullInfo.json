            "Description": "<p><span class=\"byline\">There have been hundreds of digital currencies that have launched worldwide, and more than ninety-eight percent of the digital currencies launched have failed for one reason or another. The Bytecent project was conceived to bring sanity back to an industry that has drifted away from the core principles set forth with the original Bitcoin project.<\/span><\/p><p>Bytecent is not just another digital currency in a sea of many; it is a philosophy born out of necessity. The goal of this project is to reinvent digital currencies from the manner that wallets are distributed and installed, to the method that coins are earned and spent. Bytecent is the first user-friendly digital currency designed from the ground up to be as easy as sending an email. If you can point and click a mouse, you can use Bytecent.<\/p><p><span><span>Bytecent is the first user-friendly digital currency designed from the ground up to be as easy as sending an email.

            "Technology": "<p><strong>Proof of Bytecent<\/strong> is an innovative earning system that employs captcha technology to limit network abuses while keeping the earning process tangible. POB requires workers to enter a human readable captcha code every sixty minutes to maintain the earning process without interruption. POB time can be extended without entering the captcha code by storing x amount of coins in the local wallet. For example, If 25 Bytecent are required to extend POB time for one hour, a worker will need a total of 575 Bytecent stored in his\/her local wallet to extend POB time for a total of 24 hours. Bytecent utilized for POB can be used anytime and are not locked from being spent like with Proof of Stake coins. The number of coins required to extend POB time is based on numerous factors including current price, total volume, and demand.<\/p><p>1.POB renders botnets ineffective, while dramatically reducing the effectiveness of mining farms.<\/p><p>2.POB generates demand for Bytecent while keeping the available Bytecent in circulation low.<\/p><p>3.Workers are rewarded by storing more Bytecent in their local wallets.<\/p><p>4.Sell pressure from workers and merchant dumping is significantly reduced.<\/p><p>5.Fewer Bytecent are stored on exchanges and other centralized platforms.<\/p>",
