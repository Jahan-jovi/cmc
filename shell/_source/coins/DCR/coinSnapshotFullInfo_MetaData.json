        "Description": "Decred (DCR) is one of the powerful cryptocurrency . It is open, progressive, and self-funding community-based system integrated into the blockchain. With the spirit of free participation, DCR have been provided by the necessarily technical features of any system, wallets and mining, initial funding and distribution, etc need to have.",
        "Features": "Decred includes many incredible features such as an innovative hybrid PoW and PoS consensus voting system. In addition, there is a blockchain-anchored public proposal platform which is trustful and connectible and the cross-platform wallets are easy for users to use. Other features are that smart contracts like Lightning Network are active to work and Cross-chain atomic swaps within different currencies.

        "Technology": "Decred (DCR) has been built and developed with many updated technologies such as Novel hybridized proof-of-work/proof-of-stake (PoW/PoS) consensus system. Additionally, its elliptic curve cryptography over secp256k1 is supportedby opptional Curve25519. The project is a result of the theoretical proposals brought by proof-of-activity (PoA) and MC2 in 2013. Decred development started in April, 2014 with a single developer and expanded to include developers from btcsuite shortly thereafter.PoW mining using BLAKE256 hash algorithm - Inspired by Bernstein's Chacha stream cipher, SHA3 finalist BLAKE256 offers speed as well as high security.Approximately 21 million coins - Exponential decay in subsidy or the number of coins generated per year.."
