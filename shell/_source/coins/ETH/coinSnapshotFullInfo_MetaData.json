        "Description": "Ethereum is a bright decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications run precisely as they are programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. In the Ethereum and blockchain protocols, each operation will have a reasonable price. This general idea is, for everything can be transmitted or made by the network, you have to consume or burn the gas. The cryptocurrency is called Ether and is used to pay for the computation time and the transaction fees. Besides, Ethereum is the way the Internet is supposed to work. As long as you have enough money to pay for your code that can be run by the network, the contacts will always be up and running. Ethereum was crowdfunded in August 2014 by fans all over the world. It was developed and maintained by ETHDEV with the contribution of high minds around the globe. ",
        "Features": "The first feature, maintaining a data warehouse represents something useful for other contracts or with the outside world. The second feature, serve as an external account type with a more sophisticated access policy; This is called a "forward contract" and usually involves sending back incoming emails to specific destinations only when certain conditions are met. Next, ongoing contract management or relationship between multiple users. Examples of this contract include financial contracts, collateral with certain conciliators, or some types of insurance. Finally, there are functions for other arrangements; it is like a software library.",
        "Technology": "First, Freedom: users shouldn't be restricted in what they use the Ethereum protocol for, and we should not try to prioritize or dislike certain types of Ethereum contracts or transactions that are based on the nature of their purpose. This is similar to the guiding principle behind the concept of "neutrality." Second, Generalization: Protocol features and opcodes in Ethereum should represent the lowest level concepts so that they can be connected in optional ways including ways that may not be useful today, but which can become helpful later and therefore a group of low-level concepts can be more efficiently implemented by eliminating some of its functions when not needed. Third, Have No Features: As a consequence of generalizations, development teams often refuse to build high-level use cases even as common as internal parts of protocols, with the understanding that If people really want to do that, they can always create a sub-protocol (e.g., sub-currency backend noise, bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin sidechain, etc) inside the contract. Fourth, Non-risk-aversion: An unstable group of experts with a higher level of risk if the risk is increased brings very significant benefits.",
