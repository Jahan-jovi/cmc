        "Description": "NEO is a non-profit community-based blockchain that uses blockchain technology and digital identification to digitize assets as well as automate the management of digital assets using smart contracts and real-time present a smart economy with a distribution network. NEO was founded in 2014 and is a real-time open source on GitHub in June 2015. Since its founding, NEO has experienced the explosion and boom of closed industry and frenzy. Cooling of the digital currency market. We believe that technology advances the process and creates the future together. Motivated by this, NEO was created to transform our traditional economy into a new era of smart economy.",
        "Features": "NEO has three advanced features: NeoX - As discussed earlier in this paper, NeoX aims to go through blockchains. While NEO demonstrations are not clear exactly how it will work, NeoX promises to provide interoperability between multiple blockchains, including private/public blockchain links. NeoFS - To make digital assets and smart contracts more capable, NEO is developing a file-sharing and storage system on the blockchain. This will make it easy to transfer digital files as part of a contract. And NeoQS - While not directly using user features, future NEO networks will have plans to combat attacks from quantum computers.",
        "Technology": "NEO operates on a unique unified mechanism. Instead of proof of work or evidence-share, NEO uses Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT). In dBFT, stakeholders in NEO vote for a group of employees for each block. The accounting nodes create blocks, and then the network must agree on the new block. This system requires fewer resources than other types of consensus, and it is also more capable. Using this system of elected accountants, NEO reaches 1,000 transactions per second and can theoretically reach up to 10,000 transactions per second with optimized optimizations. Compared to the current network capacity of Ethereum is 15 transactions per second, NEO has a clear advantage. This is especially true for the use of large-scale smart contracts.",
