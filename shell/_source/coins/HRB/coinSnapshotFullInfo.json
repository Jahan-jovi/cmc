It allows for experienced\u00a0<span>and entrant users in the cryptosphere alike to participate in projects the community finds interesting.\u00a0Harbour DAO also allows community members to participate in pre-funding stages of\u00a0certain projects.<\/span><\/p><p><span>The HRB token allows holders to\u00a0to create and vote on proposals for the group. The amount of votes they have is equal to the amount of tokens they hold (Stake).
