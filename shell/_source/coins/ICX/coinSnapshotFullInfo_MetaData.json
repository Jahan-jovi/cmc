        "Description": "ICON is an interchain blockchain technology that links some different blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum into a simple platform through smart contracts. ICON's goal is to "hyperconnect the world" in building one of the world's largest dispersed networks, centered around financial institutions, universities, health care and large corporations. ",
        "Features": "ICON includes many powerful features. The first feature, Usability: ICON brings blockchain technology to our everyday lives. The ICON team has been building practical applications for real communities. Also, ICON will benefit from "DAVinCI", our artificial intelligence solution that is trusted by the world's largest financial institutions. The second, Scalability: ICON is fully compatible with traditional blocks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and all other third-party blockchain networks connected to the real world. ICON blends the world of cryptography and the real world to open up and inspire new business opportunities and connections. The third, Decentralization: ICON envisions a decentralized world that includes free communities. ICON is a hierarchical network, where communities with different governance structures can connect and interact. ICON enables anyone to join the ICON Network by generating a new DAPP with independent governance.",
        "Technology": "BSI is based on intelligent contract technology. ICON uses BSI to allow the construction of digital signature infrastructure such as public key infrastructure (PKI). With ICON's current PKI system, BSI does not need to manage individual keys to issue certificates. Instead, it issues the X.509 certificate, which is issued by creating digital signatures based on information processed on the Merkle tree-based proof of existence.",
