Compelling and self-sustaining use cases are planned for Jumbucks, many of which have never yet been seen in the world of cryptocurrency. Jumbucks\u2019 core is a fork of ShadowCoin, so it immediately offers great features such as P2P encrypted messaging and anonymous dual-key stealth addresses.\u00a0<\/p>",
