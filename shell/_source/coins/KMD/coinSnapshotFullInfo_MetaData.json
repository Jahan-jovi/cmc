Secondly, Komodo platform is built on the foundation of security and privacy, bringing peace of mind. Finally, it allows the Komodo technologies and specialists to speed up your blockchain development so that you can focus on your application.",
        "Technology": "Using a new consensus mechanism that is developed by the Komodo team, Proof of Work, Komodo blocks can be justified using Bitcoin blockchain. KMD is issued through the Equihash-based PoW protocol, and new block information is sent to the pre-selected notary node. These buttons insert the Komodo block information on the BTC blockchain by creating a custom transaction. This system ensures that to "hack" Komodo, one must rewrite both lines.",
