        "Description": "Lisk is a decentralized application platform. As a secret currency, like Bitcoin and other alternatives, it provides a distributed payment system and electronic money network. The network itself, operating using a highly effective Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) model, is guaranteed by 101 democratically elected delegates. Lisk's distributed application platform, the most powerful component, enables the deployment, distribution, and monetization of custom applications and blockchains (sidechains) into the Lisk blockchain. Also, the inflation rate is 5 LISK per block, each time being reduced to 1 times until a stable LISK block is achieved per block.",
        "Features": "The Lisk network is decentralized and trusted. That means that no entity is directly controlled. This network is guaranteed by 101 elected democratic delegates. The primary responsibility is to validate and issue the validity of the transaction. All Lisk accounts on the network have the right to vote for delegates registered on the Lisk blockchain. The 101 delegates with the most votes were elected with the responsibility to confirm the validity of the online broadcasts. They also receive 100% of all network fees collected and all fake rewards.",
        "Technology": "In the 100,000,000 ICO, LISK has been presented to ICO participants, core groups, third parties and active community members. When the network is established with 101 delegates, five new LISKs will be created with each block, the Forging Awards. Every 3,000,000 blocks (~ 1 year) this rewards will be reduced by 1 LISK, ending with 1 LISK per block, where it stays the same forever. The Forging Awards will be distributed equally to all active delegates (101 and higher), just like the network fee. We have implemented this mechanism to motivate a delegate and secure the network. Also, this allows Lisk to finance itself in the future. Lisk is written in JavaScript using NodeJS.",
