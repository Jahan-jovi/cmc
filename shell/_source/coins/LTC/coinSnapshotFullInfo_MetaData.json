The Litecoin LTC provides faster transaction confirmations (2.5 minutes on average) and uses a hardware-based hardware-based proofing algorithm to determine the target for normal and GPU computers. Everyone has had - that's the main difference for Bitcoin. The Litecoin network is planned to produce 84 million units of currency each year, having the same amount as bitcoin. The coin was generated by a Google employee, Charles Lee. Litecoin is in second place with Bitcoin and has produced countless clones - however, it has a solid support platform and dedicated development team.",
        "Features": "Miners are currently offering 25 new litecoins per block, which is reduced by half in about 4 years (840,000 blocks each). Therefore, the Litecoin network will produce 84 million liters, 4 times higher than Bitcoin. The Litecoin blockchain is capable of processing higher transaction volumes than its counterparts - Bitcoin. Due to more frequent volume creation, the network supports multiple transactions without modifying the software in the future. As a result, merchants receive faster confirmation time, while still being able to wait for further confirmation when selling larger items.",
