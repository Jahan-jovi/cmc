        "Description": "MED cryptocurrency or Mediterranean Coin is one of the best hybrid algorithm-based network. Like other first generation of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin but its Proof of Work algorithm hybridscrypthash256 more stronger. That is the reason why it can increase the hashing power disproportionately.",
        "Features": "By using hybrid algorithm of Scrypt and SHA-256, Mediterranean Coin (MED) is being used to limit the ability of large miners and the hashing disproportionate power.", 
        "Technology": "Based on the Scrypt and SHA-256, MED can break the limit of the ability of large miners> In addition, we can solve the blockchain attacks and malleability problems. By the Proof of Work algorithm hybridscrypthash256 which combines the PoW algorithm of Bitcoin (SHA256) with  Litecoin PoW algorithm (Scrypt), it allows the users to reuse small USB erupters and similar small ASIC devices for mining.",
