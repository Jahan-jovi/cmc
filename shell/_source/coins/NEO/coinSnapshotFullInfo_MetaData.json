        "Description": "NEO is a platform in which users can release and trade assets. NEO represents NEO platform ownership and allows users to purchase NEO (ANC) and vote on protocol changes on the NEO blockchain. NEO is a non-profit community-based blockchain that uses blockchain technology and digital identification to digitize assets. Founded in 2014, NEO was a real-time open source on GitHub in June 2015. Since its founding, NEO has experienced the explosion and boom of closed industry, frenzy, and cooling of the digital currency market. We believe that technology advances the process and creates the future together. Motivated by this, NEO was created to transform our traditional economy into a new era of "smart economy."",
        "Features": "The first feature, Multi-Asset Support: NEO is designed from the ground up to support multiple asset types. The second, Digital Certificates: NEO uses digital certificates to form the basis of its untrusted ecosystem. Users never need to trust a party or a centralized organization. The third, Superconducting Trade Mechanism: NEO facilitates the exchange of digital assets P2P. Buyers and sellers of digital and currency assets will be treated equally without communication with third parties. Next, the complete Turing Smart Contract: Turing's full-fledged contracts have certainty and precision. NEO's smart agreement supports parallel operation, sharding, and unlimited scalability when running in NEOVM. Another great feature, Advanced Contract Customization Options: NEO is known for the customization of smart contracts. Contracts can be customized at high levels in languages such as C ++, Java and Go. That means developers can create advanced smart contracts without having to learn a new programming language.",
        "Technology": "One of the biggest threats to the blockchain technology is the invention of quantum computers. The entire base of the blockchain is based on the idea of modern computational power and its limits. A quantum computer can break the encryption, threatening the future of security and blockchain technology. NEO, however, specifically solved this problem with its technology against quantum computers. In particular, NEO has grid-based encryption and coding techniques that enable Turing solutions and decoding through the shortest vector (SVP). To put it more frankly, the SVP cannot be solved by current quantum computers, meaning NEO's future is protected from the invention of quantum computers.",
        "Sponsor": "NEO is sponsored by SYMM. It's a part of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain,=. Also,  SYMM is an ERC20-compliant smart contract. "
