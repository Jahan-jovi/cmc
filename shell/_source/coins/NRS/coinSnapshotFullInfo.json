The coin has a block reward reduction every 3000 blocks and difficulty adjustments each block. There are 80 NRS per block originally and the PoW phase is limited by a hard cap of 5million NRS. Transaction fees are destroyed and taken out of the system to counter the inflation of the PoS stage.<\/p>",
