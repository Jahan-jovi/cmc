A SHA256 coin operating on proof of work and proof of stake with a coin cap of 25 million.\u00a0<\/p><p>The idea of this coin is to lay the foundations to give car park operators the platform to integrate with cryptocurrencies with ease.<\/p><p>They see Bitcoin as the tool that is trying to revolutionize the Financial Industry and that it shouldn&#39;t stop there. There are many other industry&#39;s worldwide that could benefit from its technology.<\/p><p>ParkByte will be therefore specifically targeted at laying the foundations for processing parking transactions.<\/p><p>Currently Parking can be paid via many methods but there is not yet a crypto related method.<\/p>",
            "Features": "<p>In the UK we are able to pay for parking via Companies like RingGo, they accept Credit Card, Premium SMS methods but not Crypto.<\/p><p>These type of companies have in the previous years been putting a lot of pressure on conventional coin and ticket machine manufacturers because their system is cost effective. Cobalt, RingGo&#39;s parent have now \"securely processed over \u00a3 1 billion\" for \"4,000 sites across the UK, by more than 60 local authorities, 10 railway operators and numerous private parking operators\".<\/p><p>After having worked in the Parking Machine Manufacturing Industry for 5 years, the coin developers can see there being a huge amount of potential for this coin, its unique iOS \/ Android APPs and the backend processing servers.<\/p><p>The coin will provide basic functionality, they could then explore maybe a type of CMS marketplace where developers sell their own themes, plugins etc. for the backend server used by the parking companies.<\/p>",
