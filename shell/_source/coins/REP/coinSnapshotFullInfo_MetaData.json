        "Description": "Augur is an open, global platform where people can create, monitor or market prediction markets on any subject. Augur is a decentralized prediction market that can predict the outcome of an event based on the 'crowd wisdom' principle. With this method, the information gathered from the crowd is averaged into the most practical and therefore the most likely outcome. Accurate predictions are rewarding networks, while inaccurate reporting is penalized - this encourages honest reporting.",
        "Features": "Augur aims to revolutionize the prediction market, and to do so, change the way people receive and verify 'truth.' The main idea is to make more exact predictions of larger groups rather than a small group of experts. Also, People can set events on any topic and buy shares for the possible outcomes of those events. Ether and bitcoins are accepted on the platform. Algorithms will then work with a wide range of information and provide consensus-based top predictions. Once the event is signed, the funds attached to the share of the exact result are distributed to the 'winner'.",
        "Technology": "Augur was built on the basis of Ethereum blockchain as it will run on smart contracts, also saying it will run along the Bitcoin blockchain so that both the Ether and Bitcoin can be exchanged in the Augur.",
