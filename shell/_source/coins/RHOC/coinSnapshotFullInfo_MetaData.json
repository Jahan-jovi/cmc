        "Description": "RChain also known as RHOC is a multiple blockchains in crytocurrency. The platform design results from the inspirations of earlier blockchains and builds on top of the shoulders of giants in the disciplines of mathematics and programming language design. In mid-2016, Rho Virtual Machine which is a concurrent execution engine run Rholang contracts, which was the foundation for the Smart contracts are verified on Rchain.",
        "Features": "RChain's independence make it become competitive blockchain because it is partitioned or sharded by default. Therefore, the network of blockchains are coordinated and parallel. In addition, it provides a scalable and concurrent smart-contract including a lot of industry-leading functions such as Meta-programming, Reactive Data Streams and Pattern Matching.",
        "Technology": "The RChain decentralized applications platform is powered by the Rho Virtual Machine. About the network, RChain implementates a direct node-to-node communication running the RChain platform and a set of Apps on the top of it. Additionaly, RHOC maximum supply provided is more than 870 million.",
