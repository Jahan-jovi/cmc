        "Description": "Sia is a well-developed decentralized storage platform. Users around the world contribute disk storage from their computers to form a hierarchical network. The scaling of the Sia network allows for many optimizations of latency, throughput, reliability, and security. The decentralized nature of the Sia network allows people with paid storage, reduced entry barriers, and reduced overall cloud storage.",
        "Features": "Sia uses a new cryptocurrency, called siacoin. The most important features of Sia can only be accessed using siacoins. All storage contracts and all Sia payment channels require the possession of siacoins. This requirement means that when Sia grows in use, there will also be demand for siacoins. As demand increases, prices will increase. If Sia is being used for billions of dollars of storage, billions of dollars of siacoins will be required. The value of siacoin attached cannot be separated from the amount of storage being used on the Sia network.",
        "Technology": "The foundation of Sia is a proof of the work blockchain. A storage contract is a new type of transaction executed by blockchain. The hash algorithm of Sia is blake2b. Also, p2pool and multisig wallets are supported on the Sia.",
