            "Description": "<p>Smart Investment Fund Token (SIFT) is an ERC20-compliant smart contract\u00a0within the Ethereum blockchain that pays dividends in ether monthly. Each\u00a0SIFT represents a single share in a volume-trading investment fund for\u00a0cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Dash and Litecoin. In\u00a0addition to monthly dividends, shareholders will also be able to trade their\u00a0tokens at market rates allowing them to cash-out as the fund value increases\u00a0over time.<\/p><p><br \/>The SIFT ICO will release an unlimited amount of SIFT tokens for a period of\u00a045 days at an exchange rate of 0.01ETH per SIFT. Each SIFT will represent a\u00a0single share in the fund directly proportional to the number of issued tokens\u00a0giving no shareholder more priority than others. The majority of raised\u00a0funds will be used for trading purposes, with a small percentage of the fund\u00a0being held back for prudent reserves and administration. This means that\u00a0whether the fund launches with 100,000 SIFT or 1,000,000 SIFT the\u00a0percentage return for an individual will stay the same.<\/p>",

Each SIFT is not only tradeable, allowing investors to freely buy and sell SIFT in the open market, the fund also pays monthly dividends to its investors based on the fund&#39;s trading performance. Investing in SIFT allows you to easily become involved in the complicated crypto asset markets without the risk and technical barriers that are otherwise present. Even with a small investment it also allows clients to receive what we expect to be a fairly large monthly dividend payout each month.<\/p><p>The Ether raised will be liquidated to fiat currencies.<\/p><p><strong>Team<\/strong>:<\/p><ul><li>Guy Powell:\u00a0CTP<\/li><li>James May:<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Trade systems.
