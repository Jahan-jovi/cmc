        "Description": "Skycoin is an open source project that is the result of a large collaborative effort among many interdependent teams. It started in 2012 with the original purpose of resolving some bitcoin issues and limiting and introducing the UXT model, the CoinJoin protocol, and the price ceilings. Hence, as time passed, it has evolved into a multi-layered technology platform that becomes the foundation for decentralized internet.",
        "Features": "The first feature, Speed: Skycoin transactions take at least 4 seconds. No bottlenecks or fees, Skycoin is faster than other secret codes and competes with credit cards and Apple Pay. It's perfect for Point of Sale (POS) and IOT applications. The second, Private: The transaction is anonymous and can not be looked up. Skycoin uses G. Maxwell's CoinJoin protocol to combine transactions from multiple wallets, giving you total privacy online. The third, Protect: Skycoin is safe. It was built from the ground in Golang, using coding standards that were tested over time. That means that your transactions cannot be tampered with. Skycoin protects you from threats such as 51% off, reverse, copy and resilience. Moreover, Ecosystem: The Skycoin universe is growing. We are expanding our ecosystem of multi-functional tools and real-world web applications to improve your experience. Finally, Sustainability: Skycoin is environmentally friendly. It does not waste electricity by tapping. Supported by the first new consensus algorithm since PeerCoin, Skycoin avoided the evidence-based (POW) and costly (POS) process.",
        "Technology": "Skycoin is a cryptocurrency that is written from scratch in Golang. It does not use PoW and PoS and is based on Obelisk, a unified network algorithm, replacing both PoW and PoS with a reliable network. Skycoin focuses on the core features, security, usability and simplicity of Bitcoin instead of adding the gimmick marketing features.",
