Instead, they vouch for borrowers who apply for a loan through lending partners.<\/p><p>Customers can find borrowers that are looking for their loan\u2019s guarantors. The voucher can check the borrower\u2019s profile and choose whether to vouch for the borrower if their default risk and earning amount suit them.<\/p>",
