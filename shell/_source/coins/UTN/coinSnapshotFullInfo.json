            "Description": "<p><span>Universa is a\u00a0<\/span>blockchain cryptoprotocol\u00a0with an emphasis on tokenization and contractual agreements.\u00a0It uses a contract execution machine and a distributed state ledger.<\/p><p><span>The Universa Nodes primary function is to execute contracts and verify state. In Universa, permission to create new blocks comes from participation as a licensed node. Therefore, rather than waiting for a new block to be mined, a state change can occur at any time, verified by a trusted player, and approved by consensus. Each separate contract maintains its own chain of state (Smart Contract Chain - C-chain), so a contract can perform actions asynchronously without blocking or affecting other contracts, and the combined changes of state collectively form a directed acyclical graph (\u201cDAG\u201d) that makes up the blockchain itself.<\/span><\/p><p><span>UTN is the token powering Universa&#39;s ecosystem.\u00a0<\/span>Execution of Smart Contract actions requires transaction fees paid in UTN to reward participating nodes. Universa\u00a0holds the right to \u201cburn\u201d up to 1% of the fees retained by the platform daily.<\/p>",
