        "Description": "Veritaseum is a smart contract-based interface that allows people to create, import and manages smart contracts without any intermediary, intermediary or centralized authority. Veritaseum will allow users to interact with real products based on blockchain technology and smart contracts, including P2P trading value, P2P letter of credit and DAOs. VERI tokens will enable users to interact with the Veritaseum wallet interface.",
        "Features": "Some features of VERI coin include: Firstly, Fast Transactions with Optimal Fees: VeriCoin transactions are faster than 10 Bitcoins and are even faster when combined with Verium. The transaction fee is very small. Secondly, High Mining Rewards: Miners earn Verium through Work Time Proof (PoWT) with higher fees and slower block times. Thirdly, CPU Mining = Decentralization: Verium can be exploited by anyone with a computer or laptop. Verium is the ability to fight ASIC and GPU allows people to participate. This creates a more decentralized network and security than centralized mining schemes. Finally, Two Way Communication: VeriCoin and Verium are designed to be compatible with shared addresses and private keys. When Artis releases in the future (see Roadmap), you can easily exchange your Verium & VeriCoin through strings without the need for a third party.",
        "Technology": "VeriCoin and Verium are the first dual-mode blockchain protocol technologies to pair digital currency with digital reserve. This means faster, more secure transactions and resolving digital puzzles about scalability. Currency coins are now facing an impossible task of trying to become a fast-paced currency and a valuable security store. VeriCoin and Verium work together to solve this problem with a breakthrough dual-blockchain system called Binary-Chain. Secure binary value chains, secure and accelerate transactions by promoting Poof [Proof of Stake-Time] and PoWT (Proof of Work) into a new ecosystem.",
