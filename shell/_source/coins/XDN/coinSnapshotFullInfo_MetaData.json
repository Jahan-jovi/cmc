        "Description": "XDN is an open-source cryptography platform that provides secure, streamlined protection of encrypted, unsecured instant messages, secure GPUs, and ASIC-resistant exploits. The XDN also offers a blockchain deposit that provides periodic benefits on funds that have been locked to protect the network. The XDN was first launched on May 30, 2014 right after the conflagration of BCN and Monero on April 18, 2014. With a maximum supply of 8,589,869,056, BCN 184,460,000,000 and XMR 18,400,000, the maximum supply of XDN was decided based on industry research designed for mass adoption.",
        "Features": "XDN includes many flexible features. Firstly, Anonymous: DigitalNote anonymous transactions are anonymous and pass encrypted information in a decentralized P2P network. Secondly, Instant Encrypted Messages: DigitalNote provides a safe, unmanageable and inaccessible communication with encrypted communications. Thirdly, Blockchain deposits: DigitalNotes may be locked in deposit accounts for a period of 0.5-1% annual interest. Deposit is a major supply factor. Moreover, Libertarian economy: DigitalNote distribution occurs with fair ASIC feasible mining procedures. Block Reward = 150 XDN ~ 1 year after launch. Finally, Safe and ASIC-resistant: XDN announced was public and loud. Since the first block, it is exploited by the community user cryptocurrency with effective PoW CPU.",
        "Technology": "DigitalNote XDN is a cryptocurrency, a decentralized digital currency, such as Bitcoin. It is based on CryptoNote's anonymous technology and is updated with unique unencrypted cryptographic messaging and blockchain-based messaging. No one owns or controls DigitalNote, it uses peer-to-peer technology and exploits PoW's proprietary ASIC operations without the central authority.",
