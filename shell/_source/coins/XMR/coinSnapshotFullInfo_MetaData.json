        "Description": "Monero (XMR) is an open source cryptocurrency that Ã­ generated April 2014 focused on privacy and decentralization running on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, and FreeBSD. XMR uses a public ledger to record transactions while new units are created through a process called mining.ure system to protect your privacy, enabling the user to execute the unpredictable transaction. Besides, Monero (XMR) is a cryptonight algorithm that is based alternative cryptocurrency. Coins are based on Proof of Work and have a variable reward. ",
        "Features": "Monero includes lots of strong features. The first feature, Privacy (Untraceable payments, Unlinkable transactions). It uses the original CryptoNote protocol except for the initial changes (as the block time and emission speed). This protocol itself is based on ring signatures (Daniel J. Bernstein's Curve25519 + Ed25519, Schnorr signatures on a Twisted Edwards curve) and stealth addresses. The result is passive, decentralized mixing based on heavily-tested algorithms. The second, It's decentralization. It will allow transparent CPU mining on the user's computer, far from the de facto centralization of mining farms and pool mining. Finally, it is scalability. Monero has no hardcoded limitation, meaning it has no 1 MB block size limit that prevents scalability.",
        "Technology": "This coin integrates powerful technologies. It's PoW algorithm: CryptoNight. Max supply: Infinite (see note below); Block reward: Smoothly varying; Block time: 120 seconds; Difficulty: Retargets at every block.",
        "Sponsor": "The following businesses have sponsored the Monero Project with the goal to bring financial privacy to the world. They are JetBrains, Dome9 Security, Kitware, Fork Networking, Araxis, Navicat, and Symas."
