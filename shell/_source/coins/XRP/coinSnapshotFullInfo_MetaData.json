        "Description": "Ripple puts itself as an addition to, rather than a competitor, Bitcoin - this site has a dedicated page for Ripple for bitcoiners. A ripple is a distribution network which means that transactions occur immediately on the network - and because it is peer to peer - this network is capable of fighting systemic risk. The ripple is not exploited - unlike Bitcoin and its partners - but each transaction destroys a small amount of XRP, adding a deflation measure to the system. Currently, there are 100 billion XRP.",
        "Features": "The first feature, Math-Based Currency: A math-based currency, also known as Cryptocurrency, is a digital asset with verifiable mathematical properties, similar to how we can verify gold in a certain way. A substance made of atoms with 79 protons. Math-based currencies exist in the form of digital assets at their own discretion and may be transferred directly between users without relying on the centralized protocol regulator. XRP exists as a math-based currency based on the Ripple protocol. The second, Abuse Protection: XRP's main function is to protect the Ripple Protocol against Denial of Service (DoS) spam attacks. Since the Ripple protocol is based on a shared account, a malicious attacker can create large amounts of "spam ledger" (such as fraudulent accounts) and "transaction spam" (such as transactions) to try to overload the protocol. This can cause the size of the ledger to become unmanageable and interfere with the ability of the protocol to quickly resolve legitimate transactions. The third feature, Bridge Currency: XRP is as big as a bridge. Because the balance of each transaction port is a separate asset in the ripple, the number of potential currency pairs can become quite large. Rather than quoting every combination of currencies/ports, XRP can serve as a useful bridge to enable transfers. ",
        "Technology": "The first technology, Ledger and consensus: The Ripple protocol is, at its core, a shared public database. This database includes a ledger, which monitors account activity and balances related to them. The ledger is a distributed database - a record of accounts, balances and perfect transactions, perfect in the protocol ripple. It is updated continuously and automatically by Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) so that an identical ledger exists on thousands of servers around the globe. At any time, anyone can review the ledger and view a record of all operations on the Ripple protocol. The second technology, The Worldâ€™s First Distributed Exchange: No one owns or controls the Ripple protocol. It runs on computers all over the world, all working together to continuously maintain a record of accounts, balances and transactional integrity. Distributed networks provide many benefits for centralized networks. Because the network is "self-clearing," it eliminates the need for a centralized operator (and gets rid of the associated layer of the fee). ",
        "Sponsor": "Ripple is created by CryptoCompare. Founded in November 2014, CryptoCompare starts launching the coin. Ripple is one of them."
