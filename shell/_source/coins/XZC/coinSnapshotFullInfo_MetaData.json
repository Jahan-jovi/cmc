        "Description": "XZC or ZCoin is a kind of a Proof of Work cryptocurrency. By using the Lyra2 hashing algorithm, it is an implementation of the Zerocoin protocol that was trusted by customers because of financial anonymity. Moreover, it is found that the Zcoin protocol have a typographic bug that is considered as roughly $400,000 USD network.",
        "Features": "Through Zero-Knowledge cryptographic proofs, XZC which brings users about the complete privacy. Besides, the Zcoin has its own platform and foundation called the Zerocash Protocol. Although Zerocash is developed based on relying on different cryptographic assumptions with various tradeoffs.",
        "Technology": "XZC is known as the first full implementation of the Zerocoin Protocol. Moreover, the Zcoin was built by Lyra2 hashing algorithm, therefore, no one can break your privacy. Besides, everyone enable to participate the platform or network like powerful corporations.",
