        "Description": "0x is an open protocol designed to provide distributed delegation as part of the Ethereum blockchain. 0x was created using a protocol that involves intelligent communications. Ethereum allows people around the world to operate decentralized exchanges. The group behind 0x strongly believes that in the future you will find thousands of tokens from Ethereum and 0x that can provide an effective and reliable way to exchange them. 0x is generated to be different from both centralized and hierarchical exchanges, offering the best combination of features.",
        "Features": "The ZRX protocol has many interesting features. First of all, it is trustless. Users can order directly from their Ethereum wallet without having to deposit money into the exchange; so there is no partner risk. Second, it allows for more payment because anyone using the protocol can access the order from anyone else. Therefore, there may be an unlimited number of exchanges based on the protocol, but each of them can pay on all other transactions. Therefore, the ZRX itself does not depend on any single exchange but can benefit from the sum of all exchanges. Similarly, all transactions built on it are beneficial for reaching total liquidity. Network performance is very strong for both ZRX investors and the people who create and use exchanges with it. Third, the protocol is written in such a way that it can have its cake and eat it too. In general, there are restrictions on hierarchical transactions, such as the speed at which orders are placed and the execution of orders. However, with the ZRX protocol, the command can be run off-chain, with blockchain being used only for the transaction part of the transaction. This allows the exchange to use ZRX to have both the speed and feel of a traditional exchange, with the distrust of a decentralized exchange.",
        "Technology": "Ethereum Blockchain is an open and borderless financial system representing a lot of assets such as cryptographic tokens. Fortunately, the ZRX has integrated this technology.",
        "Sponsor": "The 0x protocol sponsored by Pantera, Jen Advisors, Blockchain Capital, and Fintech Blockchain Group describe many of the benefits of this project."
